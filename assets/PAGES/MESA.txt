Mesa GL Support

NOTE: FOR SPECIFIC ADRENO 7xx USERS, PLEASE STRICTLY REFER TO THIS POST:
https://www.reddit.com/r/termux/comments/15dpv5y/prootdistro_ubuntu_adreno_7xx_gpu_series/

THIS POST IS ONLY FOR UNIVERSAL GPU: Mali G Series (2019-LATER), IMMORTALIS (2022)

FOR AMD RDNA2 GPUs(Xclipse), PLEASE TRY TO INSTALL AMD's GL LIBRARIES INSTEAD OF FOLLOWING THE INSTRUCTION

For GPU that's released 2018 and before may experience extreme artifact issues, especially in wayland render

ALSO I CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT THIS WOULD WORK IN YOUR DEVICE

Hello, this guide is extremely complicated as this instructions only to require you a Debian-based distros like Ubuntu, Pardus and Debian Itself, but for other distros, please seek help on Reddit for that, as i cannot help you with that

Requirements: 
    - Debian Based distros
    - git
    - cmake, make , ninja and most devel packages that has a rendering libraries 
    - A working and functioning Human brain

First, prepare a Debian PRoot

Clone this: https://github.com/Grima04/mesa-turnip-kgsl

Or just Grab This:
https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa

Then modify the /etc/apt/sources.list to this, assuming your debian is 12:

deb http://deb.debian.org/debian/ bookworm main contrib nonfree
deb-src http://deb.debian.org/debian/ bookworm main contrib nonfree

DO NOT REMOVE THE SECURITY REPOS! DO NOT REMOVE THE SECURITY REPOS!

then run this:

$ apt-get build-dep mesa

Then, download all devel packages that relate to composition and also install: Clang, cmake, gcc, make  

Or you can just proceed straight ahead

Then run This (assuming youre in the cloned repo dir):

mkdir build
cd build
meson ..
sudo ninja install


Although i would recommend you to follow this instruction instead to tweak the compiling:

https://mesa3d.org/install.html
https://mesa3d.org/meson.html


Restart your session and make sure the libraries that were compiled are exported in variable so that it should work
