Source of Tarballs: The User acknowledges and agrees that the Proot-distro repositories maintained by Termux Developers should be the exclusive and authorized sources of tarballs for the distribution files required by the Software. The User should agree not to obtain or use third-party copies of the tarballs that may compromise the integrity or security of their device.

4. Compatibility and Limitations: The User acknowledges that the Author is not responsible for any incompatibility issues arising from the following:

e. Running in Root Mode: Operating the Software in root mode may result in incompatibilities or unintended consequences.
f. Lack of Systemd Functions: The Software may not have access to systemd functions due to the isolated environment in which it operates.
