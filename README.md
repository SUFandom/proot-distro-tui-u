## SUGGESTIONS

[**XSDL BY PELYA**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=x.org.server)

When Attempting to use X11, use XSDL with Pulseaudio support for better Experience


To activate LLVMPIPE:
```
sudo apt install tigervnc tigervnc-xorg-extension -y
```
Tigervnc works together with LLVMPIPE than XSDL, If you want to run Mesa on XSDL, you have to recompild Mesa-utils (Custom Library)
